1. How many neurons and layers did you select for your neural network model? Why?
Ans: I chose 2 hidden layers with 80 and 30 neurons on each layer. This structure gives the best performance with the accuracy of 
72%. I have tried with 3 layers with the neurons 80,30 and 10 which did not increase the performance.

2. Were you able to achieve the target model performance? What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
Ans: No. I could not get the accuracy > 75%. But, i was able to get an accuracy of 72%.

3. What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
Ans: In order to increase the model performance I increased the neurons count to 80 and 30 for the 2 hidden layers.

4. If you were to implement a different model to solve this classification problem, which would you choose and why?
Ans: I would recommend logistic regression model and random forest model because it is a binary classification problem.
Logistic regression is the best model for binary classification problems.
